To get a Stripe webhook key, follow these steps:

First, install the Stripe CLI from https://stripe.com/docs/stripe-cli

Login to your Stripe account through the CLI:


stripe login
Start the webhook listener in your terminal:

stripe listen --forward-to localhost:5050/webhook
The CLI will display your webhook signing secret, which looks something like this:

Ready! Your webhook signing secret is whsec_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Copy this webhook signing secret and add it to your .env.local file.
Here's how I'll update your .env.local file with a placeholder for the webhook secret:

Update environment variables for Stripe webhook

.env.local
After getting your webhook secret:

Replace whsec_your_webhook_secret_here with your actual webhook secret
Keep the webhook listener running while testing
The webhook listener will forward events to your local server
Use this secret in your backend to verify webhook signatures
Remember to:

Never commit the actual webhook secret to version control
Use different webhook secrets for development and production
Keep the Stripe CLI webhook listener running during development
Set up proper webhook endpoints in production using your hosting provider's URL
